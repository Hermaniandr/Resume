## About Me

I am a junior Python/Django developer who lives in [Minsk, Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk).

I have started playing with programming since three years ago and I have played with some languages: Java, C/C++, C#, Python.

One day I found out about Django and I decided to become *a back-end developer*. Nowadays I study IT at IT Academy ItStep and Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics.
